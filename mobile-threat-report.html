<p>    <a name="why-mobile-security" id="why-mobile-security"></a></p>
<h2 id="Why Mobile Security?">Why Is Mobile Security Important?</h2>
<p>Mobile devices are the fastest growing consumer technology, with 
worldwide unit sales expected to increase from 300 million in 2010, to 
650 million in 2012<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup>. Mobile 
applications are likewise booming. In June 2011, for the first time ever
 people on average spent more time using mobile applications (81 
minutes) than browsing the mobile web (74 minutes).<sup><a href="#reference2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>While once limited to simple voice communication, the mobile device 
now enables us to also send text messages, access email, browse the Web,
 and even perform financial transactions. Even more significant, apps 
are turning the mobile device into a general-purpose computing platform.
 In just three short years since introducing the iPhone SDK in 2008, 
Apple boasts over 425,000 apps available for iOS devices. Seeing 
similarly explosive growth, the Android Market now contains over 200,000
 apps after only a short period of time.<sup><a href="#reference3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>As mobile devices grow in popularity, so do the incentives for 
attackers. Mobile malware, for example, is clearly on the rise, as 
attackers experiment with new business models by targeting mobile 
phones. Recently over 250,000 Android users were compromised in an 
unprecedented mobile attack when they downloaded malicious software 
disguised as legitimate applications from the Android Market<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The emergence of mobile payments is another key driver of mobile 
threats. The value of mobile payment transactions is projected to reach 
almost $630 billion by 2014, up from $170 billion in 2010<sup><a href="#reference5">5</a></sup>.
 Vendors, retailers, merchants, content providers, mobile operators, and
 banks are all actively establishing new payment services. Mobile 
payments create an attractive target for attackers, as they allow direct
 monetization of attacks. </p>
<p>In addition to financial information, mobile devices store tremendous
 amounts of personal and commercial data that may attract both targeted 
and mass-scale attacks.</p>

<h2 id="Mobile Platform Comparison">Mobile Platform Comparison</h2>
<p>Although history has repeatedly demonstrated that it is virtually 
impossible to create a perfectly secure system, mobile operating system 
developers have learned from security mistakes of the PC world. Android 
and iOS have each taken an innovative approach to securing both the 
operating system and application distribution process. </p>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<p>On the device itself, Apple’s iOS security model runs each 
third-party application in an isolated environment so that the 
application may only access its own data and permitted system resources.
 All third-party applications are granted access to the same data and 
capabilities on the device with the exception of a few, such as location
 data and push notifications, which require a user to opt in for each 
application.</p>
<p>In terms of app distribution, Apple’s App Store for iOS utilizes a 
curated app review model in which all apps submitted by developers go 
through a manual review process with restrictions based on policies 
regarding issues such as data collection, API usage, content 
appropriateness, and user interface guideline compliance. This model is 
designed with the assumption that apps will only be downloaded from 
Apple’s App Store, as some security restrictions are enforced during the
 review process but not necessarily enforced on the device itself. The 
assumption generally holds, as iOS devices prevent users from loading 
applications from sources other than Apple’s App Store unless the device
 has been “jailbroken.” Jailbreaking is a process whereby the user can 
alter the phone’s operating system to gain full access (or root access) 
to the operating system and allow applications not officially vetted by 
Apple, many of which take advantage of operating system capabilities 
otherwise restricted by Apple’s review policies.</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>Android has an operating system security model that supports its open
 application distribution model. In the Android OS security model, an 
application’s capabilities are gated by “permissions” that the 
application declares when it is installed and cannot be changed at a 
later time. When installing an application, users are presented with the
 list of permissions requested by the application and can determine 
whether the permissions are appropriate for the functionality of the 
app. Permissions allow applications to access specific data and 
capabilities on a device, including location, contacts, SMS messaging, 
identity information, and the ability to access the Internet. If an 
application’s permissions seem overreaching, a user may choose not to 
install the app or may identify it as suspicious. While the Android 
permissions model enables developers to provide a broad range of 
functionality in their apps, it does rely on end users’ ability to 
evaluate permissions requested by an app at the time of installation. </p>
<p>In terms of app distribution, the Android operating system utilizes 
an open application distribution model that allows users to download 
applications from a variety of sources, including Google’s Android 
Market, Amazon’s Appstore for Android, carrier markets such as Verizon’s
 V CAST network, and other alternative app markets. Android also has a 
setting, often referred to as sideloading, which enables or disables the
 capability to download applications from other sources outside of the 
Android Market. Android enables multiple application distribution 
methods. For example, Amazon’s Appstore for Android and Verizon’s V CAST
 apps utilize a curated model with a manual review process similar to 
Apple’s, while Google’s Android Market is based on a community-enforced 
model where some security checks are performed when applications are 
submitted to the market, but it is expected that the community as a 
whole will participate in identifying malicious or otherwise undesirable
 applications. This allows Android developers to update their 
applications much more quickly than with the curated model.</p>

<p class="quote">DroidDream malware that emerged in the Android Market 
in the first quarter of 2011 utilized two exploits, Exploid and 
RageAgainstTheCage.</p>
<p>In any complex software system, there are bound to be flaws and 
security vulnerabilities. Mobile device operating systems are no 
exception. Security vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems and 
applications are regularly identified and must be fixed to prevent 
attackers from using them to compromise systems. In fact, a number of 
vulnerabilities have been exploited on both Android and iOS devices. For
 example, the <a href="http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/03/security-alert-malware-found-in-official-android-market-droiddream/">DroidDream </a>malware that emerged in the Android Market in the first quarter of 2011 utilized two exploits, Exploid<sup><a href="#reference6">6</a></sup> and RageAgainstTheCage<sup><a href="#reference7">7</a></sup>,
 to break out of the Android security sandbox, gain root control of the 
operating system, and install applications without user intervention<sup><a href="#reference8">8</a></sup>. Similarly, JailbreakMe 3.0 for iOS devices is a non-malicious web page that exploits two vulnerabilities to jailbreak a device<sup><a href="#reference9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As with PCs, software patches are used to fix vulnerabilities on 
mobile devices. In the PC world, common processes like patch management 
are relatively simple. Software vendors deliver online updates to 
licensed users on a regular schedule or as needed. On mobile devices, 
depending on the nature of the vulnerability, a patch may be as simple 
as updating a single application or as complex as a firmware update that
 involves both the device manufacturer and the carrier. Critical 
vulnerabilities on mobile devices, such as kernel or web browser issues,
 often require a firmware update if they occur in software that is 
highly integrated into the operating system. Given the differences in 
the mobile ecosystems, patch management processes vary by OS.</p>
<p>In the case of Android, Google regularly produces updates to fix 
security vulnerabilities on the Android OS within days of discovery and 
pushes the fixes into the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Next, it 
is up to device manufacturers to produce a device-specific firmware 
update incorporating the vulnerability fix, which can take a significant
 amount of time if there are proprietary modifications to the device’s 
software. Device manufacturers typically pull the patch from the AOSP 
repository, merge in their modifications, and produce a new firmware 
update. This process is complicated by the fact that a single device 
model may have a large number of updates to support carrier-specific 
customizations. Once a manufacturer produces a firmware update, it is up
 to each carrier to test it and deploy the update to users. For users, 
the process to install an update is rather simple—they typically receive
 the update over-the-air (OTA) and confirm its installation. </p>
<p class="quote">According to one report, as many as 50 percent of 
iPhone users do not regularly sync with iTunes and thus are unlikely to 
receive critical security updates.</p>
<p>On iOS, security updates typically require Apple to produce a new 
firmware build, an operator to test the firmware build, and a user to 
sync with iTunes to install the patch. Because there are fewer parties 
in the iOS ecosystem—Apple, operators, and users—firmware updates are 
typically made available more quickly to a broad base of users than with
 Android. To apply an iOS firmware update, users must sync with iTunes. 
Unfortunately, many users simply plug their iOS devices into an outlet 
to charge them and rarely sync. According to one report, as many as 50 
percent of iPhone users do not regularly sync with iTunes and thus are 
unlikely to receive critical security updates<sup><a href="#reference10">10</a></sup>. This failure to sync means that many users do not apply updates, even though they may be available.</p>
<p>Both Google and Apple are taking steps to improve the state of 
patching on their respective platforms. The Android team has made an 
announcement that it intends to enforce an 18-month minimum support 
cycle for all Android devices to ensure that devices receive software 
updates throughout their expected lifetime<sup><a href="#reference11">11</a></sup>.
 Apple has announced that its upcoming iOS 5 will support firmware 
updates downloaded over the air and will not require syncing with a 
computer to apply them<sup><a href="#reference12">12</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Conflict of Interest in Vulnerability Disclosure</h3>
<p>Many mobile devices do not offer users full control over their device
 hardware or operating system. To gain complete control, people will 
“root” or “jailbreak” their device. The process of rooting or 
jailbreaking takes advantage of operating system vulnerabilities to 
bypass security protections on a device. </p>
<p class="quote">This conflict of interest between vulnerability 
disclosure and the ability for people to fully control their own device 
poses a great security issue.</p>
<p>Software vendors want to fix vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, 
before they can be exploited and used maliciously, so well-intentioned 
researchers typically disclose vulnerabilities they find to the software
 vendor. On mobile devices, however, there is a conflict of interest. 
Because vulnerabilities are often the only way to root or jailbreak 
devices, many researchers do not want vulnerabilities to get fixed so 
they can maintain full control over their devices. The desire to gain 
full control over devices creates a disincentive for researchers to 
disclosure vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This conflict of interest between vulnerability disclosure and the 
ability for people to fully control their own device poses a great 
security issue. Once a vulnerability being used to root or jailbreak 
devices becomes public knowledge it may also be used by malicious 
attackers, like DroidDream. Until all mobile devices allow users to gain
 full control without resorting to exploits, this conflict of interest 
between control and safety is likely to continue.</p>

<p>    <a name="threats" id="threats"></a></p>
<h2 id="Threats">Mobile Threats</h2>
<p>As with PCs, there are a variety of security threats that can affect 
mobile devices. We split mobile threats into several categories: 
application-based threats, web-based threats, network-based threats and 
physical threats. For the sake of brevity, this list is intended to be a
 general overview of the most important mobile threats, not an 
exhaustive treatment of all possible threats.</p>
<h3>Application-Based Threats</h3>
<p>Downloadable applications present many security issues on mobile 
devices, including both software specifically designed to be malicious 
as well as software that can be exploited for malicious purposes. 
Application-based threats generally fit into one or more of the 
following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Malware</strong> is software that is designed to engage in 
malicious behavior on a device. For example, malware can commonly 
perform actions without a user’s knowledge, such as making charges to 
the user’s phone bill, sending unsolicited messages to the user’s 
contact list, or giving an attacker remote control over the device. 
Malware can also be used to steal personal information from a mobile 
device that could result in identity theft or financial fraud. </li>
<li><strong>Spyware</strong> is designed to collect or use data without a
 user’s knowledge or approval. Data commonly targeted by spyware 
includes phone call history, text messages, location, browser history, 
contact list, email, and camera pictures. Spyware generally fits into 
two categories: it can be targeted, designed for surveillance over a 
particular person or organization, or untargeted, designed to gather 
data about a large group of people.  Depending on how it is used, 
targeted spyware may or may not be considered malicious, such as in the 
case of a parent using a text messaging or location monitoring 
application on a child’s phone.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Threats</strong> may be caused by applications that 
are not necessarily malicious (though they may be), but gather or use 
more sensitive information (e.g., location, contact lists, personally 
identifiable information) than is necessary to perform their function or
 than a user is comfortable with.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable Applications</strong> contain software 
vulnerabilities that can be exploited for malicious purposes. Such 
vulnerabilities can often allow an attacker to access sensitive 
information, perform undesirable actions, stop a service from 
functioning correctly, automatically download additional apps, or 
otherwise engage in undesirable behavior. Vulnerable applications are 
typically fixed by an update from the developer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Web-based Threats</h3>
<p>Because mobile devices are often constantly connected to the Internet
 and used to access web-based services, web-based threats that have 
historically been a problem for PCs also pose issues for mobile devices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phishing Scams</strong> use web pages or other user 
interfaces designed to trick a user into providing information such as 
account login information to a malicious party posing as a legitimate 
service. Attackers often use email, text messages, Facebook, and Twitter
 to send links to phishing sites.</li>
<li><strong>Drive-By Downloads</strong> automatically begin downloading 
an application when a user visits a web page.  In some cases, the user 
must take action to open the downloaded application, while in other 
cases the application can start automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Browser exploits</strong> are designed to take advantage of 
vulnerabilities in a web browser or software that can be launched via a 
web browser such as a Flash player, PDF reader, or image viewer.  Simply
 by visiting a web page, an unsuspecting user can trigger a browser 
exploit that can install malware or perform other actions on a device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Network Threats</h3>
<p>Mobile devices typically support cellular networks as well as local 
wireless networks.  There are a number of threats that can affect these 
networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network exploits</strong> take advantage of software flaws 
in the mobile operating system or other software that operates on local 
(e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) or cellular (e.g., SMS, MMS) networks.  Network
 exploits often do not require any user intervention, making them 
especially dangerous when used to automatically propagate malware.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi Sniffing</strong> can compromise data being sent to or
 from a device by taking advantage of the fact that many applications 
and web pages do not use proper security measures, sending their data in
 the clear (not encrypted) so that it may be easily intercepted by 
anyone listening across an unsecured local wireless network.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Physical Threats</h3>
<p>Since mobile devices are portable and designed for use throughout our
 daily lives, their physical security is an important consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lost or Stolen Devices</strong> are one of the most 
prevalent mobile threats.  The mobile device is valuable not only 
because the hardware itself can be re-sold on the black market, but more
 importantly because of the sensitive personal and organization 
information it may contain.</li>
</ul>

<p>    <a name="trends" id="trends"></a></p>
<h2 id="Trends">Trends</h2>
<p>Mobile security issues are present on all major mobile platforms, 
though threats affect each platform differently.  In this report, we 
specifically focus on iOS and Android.</p>
<p class="quote">According to our data, in June of 2011 Android users 
were two and a half times more likely to encounter malware than just six
 months ago.</p>
<p>Application-based threats affect both iOS and Android. Currently, 
malware and spyware have primarily targeted Android devices, though 
there are commercial spyware applications available for jailbroken iOS 
devices. According to our data, in June of 2011 Android users were two 
and a half times more likely to encounter malware than just six months 
ago.  While malware has increased at a faster rate then spyware, Android
 users are still slightly more likely to encounter spyware than malware.
 Privacy issues affect both platforms.</p>
<p>Web-based threats that carry over from the PC such as phishing 
generally do not discriminate by platform. iOS has been more notably 
affected by browser exploitation although only in a non-malicious way to
 jailbreak devices<sup><a href="#reference13">13</a></sup>. Android has begun to see drive-by-downloads in the wild<sup><a href="#reference14">14</a></sup>.
 Based on the incidence of web-based threats in June 2011, approximately
 three out of ten people are likely to click on an unsafe link each 
year.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-3-in-10.jpg" class="image-full" height="235" width="500">    </p>
<h3>Application-based Threats</h3>
<p>In this section we explore some of the prevalent and emerging trends 
related to application-based threats, including distribution and 
functionality trends in malware and spyware, privacy issues, and 
application vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4>Malware and Spyware</h4>
<p>Malware and spyware are primarily targeting Android currently, though
 there are notable pieces of commercial spyware targeting iOS devices as
 well.  In 2010, spyware (targeted and untargeted) was far more 
prevalent than malware across the Android user base, but the trend has 
shifted, as malware has made significant gains against spyware. Of the 
threats Lookout detected in the wild during June 2011, 48% were malware 
vs. 52% spyware.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-app-threats.jpg" class="image-full" height="432" width="600"></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Not only has malware grown more rapidly than spyware, there has also 
been a steady growth in the number of applications infected with 
malware, increasing from 80 to 400 unique applications in the first six 
months of 2011. Worldwide, the likelihood of encountering malware varies
 from less than 1% to more than 4% depending on country.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>In the next section, we examine malware and spyware trends in three 
important aspects: how attackers entice users to download; distribution 
methods; and capabilities.</p>
<h3>Social Engineering: How Attackers Entice People to Download Malware and Spyware</h3>
<p>People, obviously, do not purposefully download malware or spyware to
 their devices, so attackers must use techniques to mislead users into 
downloading it unknowingly. Once an attacker convinces someone to 
download a malicious app, then the technical hacking can begin.</p>
<p><strong>Repackaging</strong> is a very common tactic in which a 
malware writer takes a legitimate application, modifies it to include 
malicious code, then republishes it to an app market or download site. 
The repackaging technique is highly effective because it is often 
difficult for users to tell the difference between a legitimate app and 
its repackaged doppelganger. In fact, repackaging was the most prevalent
 type of social engineering attack used by Android malware writers in 
the first two quarters of 2011. The types of applications most 
frequently repackaged with malware include games, utilities, and porn 
apps. For example, <a href="http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/05/security-alert-droiddreamlight-new-malware-from-the-developers-of-droiddream/">DroidDreamLight </a>was originally found in 20 utility, 9 porn and 5 game apps in the Android Market.<sup><a href="#reference15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The diagram below gives several examples of the types of apps that were repackaged with malware:</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-fake-apps.jpg" class="image-full" height="469" width="600"></p>
<p class="quote">Repackaged apps containing malware create a crisis of trust.</p>
<p>Repackaged apps containing malware create a crisis of trust. To the 
naked eye, a legitimate app and a repackaged version often look the same
 with the exception of their permissions. Apps repackaged with malware 
typically, though not always, require a greater set of permissions than 
the original app. In some cases, malware writers will pirate paid 
applications and make them available for free, injecting malware into 
the pirated version. The illustration in the diagram details an example 
of the process used by malware writers to take legitimate apps from the 
Android Market, repackage them with malware, and introduce the 
repackaged versions into third party app stores.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-repackage-infographic.jpg" class="image-full" height="682" width="600"></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-phone-agree.jpg" class="image-phone" height="470" width="225"></p>
<p><strong>Misleading Disclosure.</strong>  Just as PCs have had to 
contend with spyware and adware that walks the line between being 
malicious and simply being undesirable, so do mobile devices. Misleading
 apps may not necessarily violate an application market’s acceptable 
user agreement, or even their own terms of service, which makes them 
difficult to block or remove despite their being clearly undesirable.</p>
<p>One way misleading apps walk the line is to disclose their 
functionality in a way that a user would technically agree to, but is 
unlikely to actually notice, by burying the information in fine print on
 the app or in an app’s terms of use.  One example, discovered in June 
2011, is Plankton which had invasive tracking built into the app, but 
disclosed the functionality in its EULA (End User License Agreement). 
Because of this disclosure, Plankton may not be classified as malicious,
 but it’s something people probably do not want installed. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>	<img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-phone-ok.jpg" clear="both" class="image-phone-right" height="460" width="225"></p>
<p>In another example, a version of GGTracker disclosed in fine print on
 a user interface dialog that charges would be made to the user’s phone 
bill every month in the form of a premium SMS ringtone service in order 
to get access to the app, even though such services are likely entirely 
unrelated to the app’s functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Update Attacks.</strong> Recently malware writers have begun 
using application updates as an attack method in the Android Market. A 
malware writer first releases a legitimate application containing no 
malware. Once they have a large enough user base, the malware writer 
updates the application with a malicious version. Because many users 
have their devices set to automatically update applications or will 
manually update whenever a new version is available, the update attack 
technique minimizes the amount of time malware is in the market before 
it is installed on a large number of devices. We first observed this 
technique being used in the wild by the creators of Legacy (a.k.a. 
DroidKungFu), see example to the right.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3>Distribution: How Attackers Make Malware Available</h3>
<p>In order to get in front of users, malware writers use a variety of 
techniques.  In this section we cover some of the most notable 
distribution trends we’ve seen thus far in 2011.</p>
<h4>Shotgun Distribution</h4>
<p class="quote">The makers of DroidDream published over 80 unique 
applications with DroidDream and DroidDreamLight malware variations 
under a variety of developer names</p>
<p>Malware writers target both the official Android Market as well as 
alternative, geographically targeted markets. In many cases, attackers 
will publish a large number of apps across multiple developer accounts 
and multiple markets in order to maximize the number of users they 
infect. For example, the makers of DroidDream published over 80 unique 
applications with DroidDream and DroidDreamLight malware variations 
under a variety of developer names, while Legacy has been published in 
over 60 apps primarily distributed outside the Android Market.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-droiddream-infected-apps.jpg" class="image-full" height="375" width="600"></p>
<p class="quote">In the case of malvertising, a malware writer buys mobile ads, directing users to download malware</p>
<p><strong>Malvertising</strong> or “malicious advertising” is another 
tactic used by attackers to lure people into downloading malware.  
Because legitimate developers commonly use in-app advertisements to gain
 more users, people are used to downloading apps via advertisements.  In
 the case of malvertising, a malware writer buys mobile ads, directing 
users to download malware on the Android Market or from a fake site 
designed to imitate the Android Market. <a href="http://blog.mylookout.com/2011/06/security-alert-android-trojan-ggtracker-charges-victims-premium-rate-sms-messages/">GGTracker </a>used
 malvertising to successfully encourage many people to download malware.
 The makers of GGTracker created an extremely vague ad, “Game Request,” 
that looks like a notification and directs a user to a malicious website
 that imitates the Android Market and automatically starts a 
drive-by-download, see an example below. </p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-malvertising.jpg" class="image-left" height="568" width="500"></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-ggtracker-screenshot.jpg" class="image-right" height="214" width="356"></p>
<p><strong>Drive-by-Downloads</strong> are a class of technique where a 
web page automatically starts downloading an application when a user 
visits it.  Drive-by-downloads can be combined with clever social 
engineering tactics (e.g. GGTracker) to appear as if they are 
legitimate. On Android, because the browser does not automatically 
install downloaded applications, a malicious website also needs to 
encourage users to open the download to actually infect the device with 
malware. The GGTracker drive-by-download site also encouraged users to 
click on the app download notification, claiming that the app is a 
“trusted download.” Drive-by-downloads are significant because malicious
 apps are hosted outside of app markets where they might otherwise be 
more easily detected.</p>
<h3>Malware Capabilities</h3>
<p>In addition, trends of how malware and spyware get on to mobile 
devices, there are also emerging trends in what such applications do 
once they are installed. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="quote">Malware using premium-rate SMS messages began targeting U.S. users in early June.</p>
<p><strong>Premium-rate Text Messages (SMS Messages)</strong> are an 
important way for people to charge purchases to their phone bills. 
Because of its ease-of-use as a phone payment mechanism, SMS billing is 
used by many legitimate services; however, malware can also use 
premium-rate SMS messages to steal money.  Previous instances of malware
 targeted users in Russia and China, but malware using premium-rate SMS 
messages began targeting U.S. users in early June with the emergence of 
GGTracker. Premium-rate SMS malware will also typically intercept any 
SMS messages from the SMS service to prevent a user from becoming aware 
of the charge. This type of malware has even been able to dynamically 
support multiple premium-rate SMS services. For example, GGTracker 
utilized over 15 different apps and 21 different SMS shortcodes.</p>
<p><strong>Bots</strong> are an emerging trend in mobile malware that, 
like their PC counterparts, communicate with and receive instructions 
from one or more command-and-control (C&amp;C) servers, giving the 
malware writer remote control over all infected devices. Malware in the 
wild has supported a wide range of commands, including the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>send SMS messages</li>
<li>copy SMS messages stored on the device to a server</li>
<li>copy the contact list stored on the device to a server</li>
<li>install an application</li>
<li>remove an application</li>
<li>dial a phone number</li>
<li>open a web page</li>
<li>change the list of C&amp;C servers to connect to</li>
</ul>
<p>Malware writers will typically obfuscate their code and use 
encryption to hide critical data such as the list of C&amp;C server 
names.  Bots also typically obfuscate or encrypt their network traffic 
to avoid being easily detectable.  Typically, installing additional apps
 onto the device requires the user to click “yes” to the installation 
pop-up, though in cases where the malware exploits vulnerabilities (e.g.
 DroidDream, jSMSHider), a bot can install additional apps without any 
user knowledge or intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Privilege-escalation Exploits</strong> are pieces of software
 that take advantage of vulnerabilities to gain full access to a device.
  Under normal circumstances, mobile applications run in a security 
sandbox so they cannot cause too much harm; however, if malware is 
successful in escalating its privileges, it is able to perform actions 
not normally allowed to apps. DroidDream contained two exploits, 
“Exploid” and “RageAgainstTheCage,” that it used to gain root access and
 install a secondary app that allowed the malware to install additional 
apps without the user knowing. Another piece of malware, jSMSHider, was 
signed with a compromised key that also allowed it to install 
applications without user intervention on any mobile device firmware 
builds that were also signed with that key.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Spyware (Surveillance) Applications.</strong> 
Because mobile devices often carry a wealth of personal information, 
there’s a strong incentive for people to use tools to track or monitor 
mobile users. Unlike malware and untargeted spyware, targeted spyware 
apps are typically installed by somebody who has physical access to a 
victim’s mobile device.  Commercial surveillance apps promoted for use 
in monitoring spouses, children, and other targets can cost anywhere 
from a few to hundreds of dollars.  The functionality in surveillance 
apps often includes the ability to gather phone call history, listen to 
actual phone calls, view browser history, track location, gather SMS 
message history, and more. Notably, many surveillance  applications 
support Android as well as jailbroken iOS devices. These apps often have
 very legitimate use cases and are not always used maliciously. </p>
<h3>App Threat Profiles</h3>
<p>DroidDream is malware that became available via the Android Market in
 Q1 2011 and has affected an estimated 250,000 mobile users to date.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-droiddream-prevalence.jpg" class="image-full" height="618" width="600"></p>
<p class="quote">The makers of the DroidDream malware family have 
continued to publish new infected applications and we’ve seen over 80 
unique instances to date.</p>
<p>Discovered in early March 2011, DroidDream is an example of malware 
that acts as a bot and uses two exploit payloads in its attempts to gain
 root access to infected devices.  Once the malware exploits a device, 
it attempts to contact a remote server and accept commands.  Since the 
initial discovery of DroidDream we’ve seen a variant, DroidDreamLight, 
emerge in late May 2011 that also acts as a bot but does not contain 
exploit code<sup><a href="#refence16">16</a></sup>. The makers of the 
DroidDream malware family have continued to publish new infected 
applications and we’ve seen over 80 unique instances to date.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-droiddream-infected-apps.jpg" class="image-full" height="375" width="600"></p>
<p class="quote">Third, it is one of the first known instances of 
Android malware specifically targeting U.S. users by silently charging 
money to users’ phone bills when it is installed, charging $10 per 
service.</p>
<p>GGTracker is a notable step in the trend of malware writers building 
more sophisticated, end-to-end attacks. First, it is one on the first 
pieces of Android malware we’ve seen to-date that engages in 
malvertising to trick users into visiting a malicious web site. Second, 
the malicious website convinces people into installing malware by 
convincingly imitating the Android Market and beginning a 
drive-by-download. Third, it is one of the first known instances of 
Android malware specifically targeting U.S. users by silently charging 
money to users’ phone bills when it is installed, charging $10 per 
service. Previously, we had only seen this type of malware on Android 
target China and Russia.  Finally, it’s worth noting that GGTracker 
continues to employ a variety of distribution techniques to seed the 
market. The first apps infected with GGTracker used malvertising to 
direct users to the fake Android Market, but another wave of infected 
apps, appearing in early July, were found in the Android Market.</p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-ggtracker-prevalence.jpg" class="image-full" height="400" width="600"><br>
    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-ggtracker-infected-apps.jpg" class="image-full" height="390" width="600"></p>
<h3>Privacy Issues</h3>
<p>Mobile devices now hold a rich set of personal information including 
location, browsing history, call history, text messages, contact lists, 
email, Facebook messages, the device’s phone number, and unique 
identifiers that can be used for tracking. Apps can access personal data
 on the device, although the data available to apps differs between iOS 
and Android. Legitimate apps can use personal information to provide 
powerful features and benefits; however, the opportunity to misuse that 
information exists as well. Because they have the potential to access so
 much data on devices, many apps gather data without users being aware 
of its collection. </p>
<p>In some cases, when a developer uses third-party advertising or 
analytics libraries, they are unaware of all the personal information 
accessed.  Advertising and analytics libraries routinely gather 
sensitive data and developers don’t always pay close attention to the 
data collected by the ad or analytics libraries they incorporate into 
their applications. Several ad networks do a good job informing 
developers what choices they can make as it relates to data collection 
to serve ads. On the other hand, a number of ad networks use IMEIs and 
other sensitive identifiers as a way to uniquely track devices even 
though, most of the time, this tracking goal can be accomplished without
 transmitting sensitive data to a server.</p>
<p class="quote">on iPhone 33.9% of free applications had the capability to access location and 11.2% had the capability to access contacts</p>
<p>In the Lookout App Genome Project<sup><a href="#reference17">17</a></sup>
 report published in February 2011, we estimated that on iPhone 33.9% of
 free applications had the capability to access location and 11.2% had 
the capability to access contacts. On Android, we found that 28.2% of 
free apps in the Android Market had the capability to access location 
and 7.5% had the capability to access contacts. </p>
<h3>App Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Smartphone operating systems enforce strict security sandboxes to 
limit what applications can do, though even in the sandbox, applications
 can contain exploitable vulnerabilities.  Because mobile platforms are 
new, often introducing new APIs and security models, even skilled 
developers aren’t always aware of best security practices. While a 
number of security issues have come to light affecting both Android and 
iOS applications (e.g. leaking sensitive information to system logs, 
storing credentials in an insecure manner, improperly validating 
externally supplied data), one of the most prevalent issues is simple 
and is not unique to mobile at all: transmitting sensitive data without 
proper encryption.</p>
<h3>Insecure Data Transmission</h3>
<p>Many apps don’t encrypt the data they transmit and receive over the 
network, making it easy for the data to be intercepted.  For example, if
 an application is transmitting data over an unencrypted Wi-Fi network 
using HTTP (rather than HTTPS), the data can be easily sniffed using 
freely-available software.  In one particularly notable example, a 
number of Google services on certain versions of Android, including 
Contacts Sync, Calendar Sync, and Picasa Photo Sync transmitted their 
account credentials in plain text, making it possible for an attacker to
 gain access to other peoples’ accounts<sup><a href="#reference18">18</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Web Based Threats</h3>
<p class="quote">Currently people have a 30% likelihood of clicking on an unsafe link per year on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Web-based threats have emerged as a significant threat for mobile 
users.  Currently people have a 30% likelihood of clicking on an unsafe 
link per year on their mobile device based on detection rates from 
Lookout users. This number is likely so high because users on mobile 
devices often encounter threats targeting PCs—people read email, 
Facebook messages, text messages, and tweets on their phones just as 
they do on their PCs.  Some web-based threats such as phishing attacks 
do not discriminate based on platform—they affect Android, iOS, and PCs 
in the same way.   Other web-based threats such as websites containing 
browser exploits are OS targeted, which means that users viewing a PC 
threat from a mobile device will not be affected, though we expect more 
mobile targeted attacks in the future.  According to one study, mobile 
device users are three times more likely to succumb to a web-based 
phishing attack than desktop users<sup><a href="#reference19">19</a></sup>. </p>
<p>    <img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-report-unsafe-links.jpg" class="image-left" height="335" width="250"></p>
<p><strong>Phishing</strong> attacks are designed to trick users into 
divulging account or personal information to web pages that appear to be
 reputable sites such as financial institutions, but are actually fake. 
Approximately 1 in 20 users will click on a phishing link every year on 
Android devices based on current rates. While users are trained to look 
at browser address bars on the desktop to determine if the site they are
 visiting is really the site it claims to be, mobile browsers generally 
clip the URL or don’t display it at all making it unlikely that users 
will engage their positive PC habits when browsing on a mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>Drive-by-downloads</strong> may use spam or malvertising to 
bring users to a site that, in turn, delivers malware by automatically 
starting a download. Such attacks are a significant concern on devices 
where applications can be downloaded outside of official markets because
 malware distributed through websites can evade the greater scrutiny 
that markets provide.  See the discussion of drive-by-downloads above 
for more information.</p>
<p>	<img src="mobile-threat-report_files/mobile-threat-network-jailbreakme.jpg" class="image-right" height="535" width="267"></p>
<p><strong>Direct exploitation</strong> is a significant threat to 
mobile browsers, as there are a number of large code bases on mobile 
devices that malicious web pages can target, including the browser 
itself, image viewers, Flash, PDF readers, and more.  WebKit, the 
popular rendering engine, is a systematic risk because the default 
browsers on Android, Blackberry, and iOS all use it, creating a 
homogenous ecosystem where a single vulnerability can potentially affect
 the majority of mobile devices. Browser exploits are also very 
difficult to fix because mobile browsers and their associated libraries 
are often revisioned with firmware, which can be extremely slow to 
update, as we’ve described above.</p>
<p>In the past year, iOS has seen multiple web-based exploits in the 
wild that allow an attacker to run code as root if a user simply visits a
 web page.  These exploits first take advantage of a browser 
vulnerability to run code as the browser process, then take advantage of
 a local privilege escalation vulnerability to run code as root.  
Thankfully, we haven’t seen evidence of these exploits being used 
maliciously: they were primarily used to allow users to jailbreak their 
devices.</p>
<h3>Physical/Network Threats</h3>
<p>While web and application based threats have been on the rise for 
mobile devices, physical threats remain some of the most prevalent and 
the barrier to entry for network threats continues to decrease.  </p>
<p><strong>Lost and stolen mobile devices</strong> are so common that Lookout locates a missing device every 5 seconds. </p>
<p class="quote">Lookout locates a missing device every 5 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi Sniffing</strong> is a technique where nearby attackers
 can get access to data transmitted to or received from a mobile device.
  Barriers to entry for Wi-Fi sniffing continue to drop as easy-to-use 
tools emerge. While these tools facilitate targeted rather than 
broad-based attacks, the increased use of free Wi-Fi in airports, cafes,
 and other public places has increased the likelihood that Wi-Fi 
traffic, including account information, can be intercepted.</p>
<p>Firesheep<sup><a href="#reference20">20</a></sup> is a desktop 
browser plugin that monitors unencrypted Wi-Fi networks for nearby 
computers and mobile devices accessing popular websites (e.g. Twitter, 
Facebook, GMail) in an insecure way and allows an attacker to trivially 
hijack user accounts accessing those sites. Similarly, Faceniff<sup><a href="#reference221">21</a></sup>
 is an Android-based tool that also allows someone to hijack user 
accounts accessing popular sites on nearby PCs and mobile devices in an 
insecure way by redirecting local network traffic through the phone 
(using a technique called ARP spoofing).  While none of the techniques 
implemented by Firesheep or Faceniff are new, the ability for even a 
novice user to engage in point-and-click network hacking makes it more 
important than ever that popular sites stop using insecure network 
protocols.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>    <a name="whats-next" id="whats-next"></a></p>
<h2 id="What's Next?">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Mobile threats are evolving quickly—sophistication that took decades 
to reach on the PC is taking just a few years on mobile.  To predict 
where they are moving, it’s important analyze what dynamics are 
affecting their growth and understand what will run the same course as 
PC threats and what will be different.</p>
<p>Application-based threats are likely to continue to follow their 
existing platform distribution trends unless platforms significantly 
change their security or distribution models.  Privacy issues and 
application vulnerabilities are affecting both iOS and Android 
platforms, however malware and spyware predominately target Android.</p>
<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>The mobile malware “industry” is currently in its startup phase, with
 attackers experimenting with different distribution and revenue models.
  As the industry matures, we believe that there will be successful 
distribution and monetization patterns that emerge.  The growth in 
malware prevalence will likely follow the malware industry’s successful 
discovery and exploitation of these patterns.  Emerging patterns 
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malware that acts as a botnet, exposing an array of remotely controlled device capabilities.</li>
<li>Abuse of premium-rate text messages</li>
<li>Targeted attacks aimed at gathering sensitive data for commercial or political purposes</li>
<li>Financial fraud as more mobile finance and payment apps emerge</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to combat scrutiny in app stores—both in the curated and 
open models—we expect malware will engage in techniques to gain 
distribution while evading detection for as long as possible.  
Specifically, we expect to see a growth in upgrade attacks where a 
seemingly-legitimate app is upgraded with malware and multi-stage 
attacks where a seemingly-legitimate app’s behavior changes at runtime 
based on code or configuration downloaded from a server dynamically. </p>
<h3>Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Because vulnerabilities on mobile devices typically take a long 
period of time to patch, we predict a growth in malware using browser 
exploits to infect both Android and iOS devices as well as an increased 
use of local privilege escalation exploits by Android malware to break 
out of the default security sandbox.  Since the android security model 
does not typically allow legitimate applications to act as root, if 
malware is able to gain root on a device, it can be very difficult to 
remove. Regaining control of the device in such cases can require a full
 firmware re-flash or leveraging an equivalent vulnerability to gain 
equivalent privileges.</p>
<p>Identified application vulnerabilities will likely rise, and as more 
high value applications such as payment and banking tools come into wide
 use, we expect exploitation of these vulnerabilities to become more 
prevalent.</p>
<h3>Phishing</h3>
<p>Application-based phishing attacks (e.g. fake login/sign up screens) 
are very difficult for users to detect as mobile devices tend not to 
have a secure location indicator for native applications that can be 
used to differentiate between a legitimate application dialog and an 
illegitimate one.  As more people access sensitive accounts and services
 from their mobile devices, we expect to see an increase in phishing 
attacks launched from malware on devices.</p>
<p>We expect web-based phishing attacks to remain prevalent in the 
future as more users move towards their mobile devices as a primary 
means of reading email and browsing the web.  Just as many websites have
 both mobile and desktop views, we expect an increasing number of 
phishing attacks to create both desktop and mobile views to maximize 
their effectiveness in convincing mobile users to enter information.</p>
